DHS Clinical System consists of these components: 

1. DHS-Client.jar - An executable JAR file, which will run both the stand-alone client and the network connected client. 
Furthermore, depends on Userâ€™s selection to connect either one of the modes thus 
popped up.

2. DHS-Server.jar - An executable server-specific JAR file, which will run the networked server.

3. DHS-1.0.jar - A common JAR file, which will contain code common (Complete Code) to both client and server applications: 
- src directory containing the source files for the project 
- Any original data file(s) the candidate used to test the program
- A very simple and basic document file summarizing the design choices called design.docx
